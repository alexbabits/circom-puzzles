## Hi
* Contains educational comments for most problems. All solutions pass all tests.
* Note: Some tests were old/off so I changed them where necessary to make them work or more comprehensive.
* All solutions are done besides Suduko and Sujiko, didn't feel like wasting time on them.
* For setup/installs, refer to the rareskills repo: https://github.com/RareSkills/zero-knowledge-puzzles
* Run Tests: `yarn test ./test/<TestName>.js`

* ZK book is good, Chapter 17 is about circom. Other chapters help give you more context for circom: https://www.rareskills.io/zk-book
* "MoonMath Manual for zk-SNARKS by LeastAuthority" is good, pay them if you find it useful. It was good at going in depth into some niche topics or deeper background. Overwhelming at times: https://leastauthority.com/community-matters/moonmath-manual/
* 0xParc is good: https://learn.0xparc.org/, https://learn.0xparc.org/materials/circom/learning-group-1/circom-1/
* Maybe check out MIT lectures, I haven't looked: http://mit6875.org/, https://zkiap.com/
* Claude Sonnet 3.5 seemed to perform better than GPT-4 or GPT-4o in terms of circom ability/knowledge.
